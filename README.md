  mouse
  clicks!

- No additional installations or dependencies required (apart from Wuthering Waves). Just download and run the program!
- Light-weight and simple. No modifications to the game files, just the settings file.
- ~~Enable True Full Screen Mode / Exclusive Full Screen for potentially better performance, better smoothness, less
  stuttering, and
  less hitching.~~

## Technology

This project is built using Python and Tkinter for the UI. It checks and modifies the game's configuration files to
unlock the FPS cap using SQLite. It does not interfere with the game files and uses minimal packages as much as
possible. Compiled to EXE using PyInstaller.
Even though it's meant to be a simple Unlocker, I ended up implementing multiple checks and fail-safes that probably
wasn't needed. (sweats)
