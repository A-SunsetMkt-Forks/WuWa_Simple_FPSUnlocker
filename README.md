# Wuthering Waves (WuWa) Simple FPS Unlocker

## Introduction

This is a simple FPS Unlocker that can be used to push Wuthering Waves's max FPS cap beyond the default 60 FPS.
This Unlocker is designed to be simple to use without much frills. Automated checks and scripts mean that you can just
run the program and it will do the rest for you.

## Features

- Simple to use with clear instructions at every step of the way!
- Multiple checks and verifications to make this as bug-free and smooth as possible.
- Simple to use UI, no need for command prompts or CLI. Just run the program and navigate the UI with buttons and mouse
  clicks!
- Input your own desired FPS cap. [60 - 240 FPS]
- No additional installations or dependencies required (apart from Wuthering Waves). Just download and run the program!
- Light-weight and simple. No modifications to the game files, just the settings file.

## Technology

This project is built using Python and Tkinter for the UI. It checks and modifies the game's configuration files to
unlock the FPS cap using SQLite. It does not interfere with the game files and uses minimal packages as much as
possible. Compiled to EXE using PyInstaller.
Even though it's meant to be a simple Unlocker, I ended up implementing multiple checks and fail-safes that probably
wasn't needed. (sweats)
