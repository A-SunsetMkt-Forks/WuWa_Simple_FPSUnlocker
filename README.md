# Wuthering Waves (WuWa) Simple FPS Unlocker

## Introduction

This is a simple FPS Unlocker that can be used to **push Wuthering Waves's max FPS cap beyond the default 60 FPS**.
it also allows you to **enable True Full Screen Mode / Exclusive Full Screen** and **set your desired Full Screen Resolution**, which is not available in the game's settings.
This Unlocker is designed to be **simple to use** without much frills. Automated checks and scripts mean that you can just
run the program, and it will do the rest for you. It comes in a Windows exe executable format, so you just need to
download,
extract, and run! Mac OS support is planned for the future when the game comes out on Mac, but that is subject to
change.

## Technology

This project is built using Python and Tkinter for the UI. It checks and modifies the game's configuration files to
unlock the FPS cap using SQLite. It does not interfere with the game files and uses minimal packages as much as
possible. Compiled to EXE using PyInstaller.
Even though it's meant to be a simple Unlocker, I ended up implementing multiple checks and fail-safes that probably
wasn't needed. (sweats)
